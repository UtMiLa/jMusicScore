jMusicScore is a library of Typescript classes to represent, view and edit music scores.

It includes an example on a full note editing application that runs in modern browsers.

How to install:

* Compile all .ts files to .js (same names and locations)
* Compile /demos/app/css/jMusicScore.less to /demos/app/css/jMusicScore.css
* Copy the jQuery 1.9.1 and jQuery UI 1.10.2 files to /js. Include the .js files and the .d.ts files.
* copy the jQuery UI 1.10.2 css file here: demos/app/css/custom-theme/jquery-ui-1.10.2.custom.css
* copy the latest jasmine distribution to /tests/jasmine-2.0.0

You are welcome to use newer versions of jQuery, jQuery UI and Jasmine, if you modify the paths in the html files
accordingly.

You can find the full note editing application here: /demos/app/Noderedigering.htm

Please be patient and allow some time for more thorough documentation! This is my first github project.
